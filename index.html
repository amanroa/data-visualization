    <p class = "basic" > The first plot I created was a parallel categories plot showing the relationship between voting frequency, 
      income level, and education level. This plot shows the increase of voting - both sporadic and always - as income and education levels
    increase. The percentage of high school graduates or less who are sporadic or always voters is 64.8%. This number increases to 76.8% after 
      some college is completed, and 81.9% after college graduation. Based on this plot, it looks like increased education levels lead to 
      increased voting.

      This plot also shows income level of these voters. Most college graduates earn higher salaries than those who 
      did not graduate college or continue with their education after high school. People who have a high school degree or less tend to earn 
      less than $40k. And the people who did not finish their college degree are sort of equally split between the four income brackets - 26.3% earn
      less than $40k, 26.8% earn between $40-75k, 29.8% earn between $75-125k, and 16.9% earn more than $125k. This plot shows how an increased level 
      of education can lead to an increased income, and as a result, those people with a higher education and higher income are more likely to vote
      either sporadically or all of the time.
